## About the Program

Asteroid Impact is a Python-based arcade quiz game developed using the `pygame` library. Created by Faiyaz and Shennon as part of a science-themed digital project, the game blends space science knowledge with fast-paced gameplay. Players step into the shoes of a space miner/scientist who must extract minerals from asteroids using correct scientific knowledge, all while saving Earth from an incoming planetary threat.

The goal of the game is to learn and apply knowledge of astronomy in a fun and challenging environment. The game features multiple stages, a scoring system using in-game currency called **Doolars**, and a final boss asteroid that threatens the entire solar system.
